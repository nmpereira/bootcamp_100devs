//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
const movies = ["get it", "jingle all the way", "big momma"];

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

const firstMovie = movies[0];

// console.log(firstMovie);

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

const lengthMovie = movies.length;

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

const lastMovie = movies[movies.length - 1];

console.log(lastMovie);
